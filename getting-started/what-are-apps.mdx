A Truffle app is a set of tools you give to your Agent to accomplish a task. 
Think of it like an MCP server that lives in an ephemeral, trusted container.

At it's core, it turns a python script into a box of tools.

### Where does this stuff run?
By default, when using the client - you are connecting to an instance of the truffle firmware in the cloud. You can switch to hardware if you place an order for a Truffle-1 at anytime ;)

### How apps work
Truffle apps are toolboxes and logic available to your model in a continous loop. ChatGPT style systems are essentially agents with a single tool; `respond_to_user`.

Models using our runtime do not by default respond to their user, but instead loop over tools until they complete a short-medium term task as defined by the user prompt.

ChatGPT is simply an agent, with one tool. 
With truffle, you can give your agent arbitrarily many capabilities.

  As the image suggests, the model lives by itself ready to be slot into a sandbox of tools. 
  These sandboxes are what we call apps

### Terminology we'll use

| Term           | Description                                                                 |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App            | A set of tools given to a model to pick from, when executing a task within a runtime |
| Tool           | A function that returns context to update the state of the model            |
| Tool rollout   | A sequence of tool calls where each subsequent tool call depends on all previous tool calls |
| Task           | An initial prompt, that allows the model to perform a tool rollout          |


### Features
Out of the box, the SDK today has a few features that set it apart from other agent frameworks. 

The simple ones are stuff like;
- Guaranteed tool execution (no hallucinations)
- Conditionals
- Async tools
- Context management
- Networking
