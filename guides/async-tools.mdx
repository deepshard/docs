### Async tools in Truffle

Making your tool async allows the model to run it as a background task. This is especially useful for long-running processes, such as waiting on a slow API or performing inference. Results from async tools will automatically be appended to the context, making the experience seamless. You could, for example:

* Call multiple slow SQL databases  
* Run a deep research API call while continuing with other tasks  
* Or even launch several deep research tasks in parallel  

To make a tool async, simply add the `nonblock` flag to `@truffle.flags` before the function definition: `@truffle.flags(nonblock=True)`

```python {7}
# Here we create an async tool
# The model can do other tasks while the tool is running
@truffle.tool(
    description="Searches with Perplexity", 
    icon="magnifying-glass"
)
@truffle.flags(nonblock=True)   # This will make the tool async 
def AsyncPerplexitySearch(self, query: str) -> str:    
    # This can take however long it takes
    return self.client.perplexity_search(query=query, model="sonar-pro")
```

The default Chat app comes with an async search tool, test it out!

<Note>The app might respond to the user before the async task is finished. Once the tool finishes, its result is injected into the context, but the agent wonâ€™t proactively follow up, it will wait for your next request. </Note>
