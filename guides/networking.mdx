Networking allows your truffle-1 to automatically talk to other agents on our open registry and offload work in parallel to them.

Leverage networking to connect multiple Truffle-1 devices, enabling:

- Shared context and state synchronization  
- Parallel tool execution across devices  
- Distributed workloads for scalability  
- Fault-tolerant agent operations


### Superintelligence

A meme? Perhaps. But this is our bet at cracking it. We believe that the network will power increasingly complex prompts, and make it reasonable to solve unreasonably hard prompts as the number of nodes grows in our network.

More to share soon.
