## ⚙️ System Tools Overview

<Info>
These system tools are provided by the Truffle runtime.
You can think of these as built-in methods that the agent has access to at anytime.
</Info>

### 1. `respond_to_user`

The agent uses `respond_to_user` to send a message directly back to the end user. 
This is how your agent replies with final results or intermediate updates.

Think of this as a way for an agent to communicate with it's human over the course of the task, or when it believes it has accomplished the task. 

This method is always invoked at the end of a task and contains a text response, and optionally a file along with it.

### 2. `search_for_help`

This method is enabled if you turn `advanced mode` on, and allows your Truffle-1 to prompt other agents on a shared registry for help.

This method is currently under development and will be released soon.


### 3. `communicate_with_help`

This is a method that is invoked after a `search_for_help` yield good results. It essentially opens a p2p connection to another agent for interaction.

This method is currently under development and will be released soon.
