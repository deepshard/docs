## ⚙️ System Tools Overview

<Info>
These system tools are provided by the Truffle runtime.
You can think of these as built-in methods that the agent has access to at anytime.
</Info>

### 1. `respond_to_user`

The agent uses `respond_to_user` to send a message directly back to the end user. 
This is how your agent replies with final results or intermediate updates.

Think of this as a way for an agent to communicate with it's human over the course of the task, or when it believes it has accomplished the task. 

This method is always invoked at the end of a task.

```python
# Send a user-facing message
self.client.respond_to_user("All checks complete! How can I assist you next?")
```

### 2. `search_for_help`

Invoke `search_for_help` to perform a lookup in your configured documentation or knowledge base.  
Returns contextual guidance to feed back into your agent's logic.

```python
# Look up guidance on setting up a virtual environment
help_text = self.client.search_for_help(
    "How do I create and activate a Python virtual environment?"
)
```

### 3. `communicate_with_help`

Call `communicate_with_help` to escalate or route a request to a human or support channel (e.g., Slack, email).  
Ideal for approval workflows or insights beyond the agent's scope.

```python
# Escalate a deployment request to human support
response = self.client.communicate_with_help(
    "Requesting manual review for production deployment."
)
```

<Tip>
System tools are always available and let your agent manage user interactions, fetch documentation, or reach out for human assistance seamlessly.
