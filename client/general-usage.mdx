### Selecting an App

Choose which sandbox of tools (app) your agent will use to complete the given task.

<Card title="App Selector" img="/images/app-selector.png">
  Use the app selector to slot your model into the appropriate toolkit before submitting your prompt.
</Card>

- Your prompt will be classified as you type, assigning a relevant app based on its contents.
- Use option/alt to open the app select menu and manually select an app.

<Tip>
You can start the process of creating a new app by selecting the "Create app" option. See our [SDK docs](/docs/getting-started/setup) for more info.
</Tip>


### Writing and Submitting Prompt

Compose your instructions to the agent in the prompt bar. You can attach external files to include in the agent's context.

<Card title="Prompt Bar" img="/images/promptbar.png">
  The prompt bar lets you type, attach files, and view an autogenerated summary title for long prompts.
</Card>

<Tip>
Long prompts will have summary titles generated. These are not used by the agent; they exist for the user's experience.
</Tip>


### Running Tasks

A task is an ongoing loop of reasoning stages, tool calls, and result outputs. Your agent iterates through steps until it's ready to respond.

<Card title="Task View" img="/images/taskview.png">
  The task view displays each reasoning step, tool call, and result so you can track your agent's process.
</Card>

A step is an individual reasoning stage, tool call, and result your agent generates within a task <sub>Your agent will iterate through steps until it's ready to provide results to the user via the [Respond To User](/guides/system-tools#respond-to-user) tool</sub>


<Tip>Your agent considers each previous step when executing a new step, creating cohesion between actions</Tip>

### Pause and Lock

Control the task execution flow by using pause and lock features directly in the task view.

<Card title="Pause & Lock Hotkeys" img="/images/pause:lock.png">
  Press **P** to pause a task (halts new step generation), or **L** to lock a task (forces continuous generation until unlocked).
</Card>


<Tip>
Use pausing when you need to inspect current progress; use locking when you want uninterrupted deep analysis.
</Tip>

### Viewing Results

Each step shows a result based on the tool used. When the agent uses the Respond To User tool, that result is delivered back to you.

<Card title="Results Preview" img="/images/respond-to-user-2.png">
  Click on a step in the task view to open a preview window showing the reasoning, tool calls, and results.
</Card>
