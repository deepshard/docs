### App Select

What is an app? (See [what is an app](/getting-started/what-are-apps))
You can use option/alt to open the app select menu

/>

The app you select before submitting your prompt will determine the toolkit your agent has to complete the given task
<Tip>You can start the process of creating a new app by selecting the "Create app" option, see our [SDK docs](/docs/getting-started/setup) for more info</Tip>

### Writing and Submitting Prompt

A prompt is the user message responsible for setting the agent on a task. You can attach external files to your prompt that will be added to the agent's context.

<Tip>Long prompts will have summary titles generated. These are not used by the agent, they exist for the user's experience</Tip>

### View Running Task

A task is an ongoing loop of reasoning stages, tool calls, and result outputs your agent steps through to complete the objective specified in your prompt.

A step is an individual reasoning stage, tool call, and result your agent generates within a task. Your agent will continue to create steps until it's ready to provide results to the user via the respondToUser tool (see system tools).

<Tip>Your agent considers each previous step when executing a new step, creating cohesion between actions</Tip>

Pause and Lock

Pause: you can pause your task by pressing P in your taskview. Pausing a task prevent further steps from being generated

  alt="Task paused"
/>

Lock: You can lock your task by pressing L in your taskview. Locking a task forces your agent to continue creating steps until you unlock it by restricting the agent's use of the respondToUser function until the task is unlocked.

<Tip>This can be useful for deep research tasks, comprehensive analysis, or anything else that you want your agent to spend a controlled amount of time on</Tip>

### Viewing Results

Each step will have a result based on the tool used. When your agent uses the respondToUser tool, that step's result will act as a report on previous steps and prompt the user to continue the interaction.
Clicking on a step will open an associated preview window. This window will contain the step's reasoning stage, tool call, and result.
