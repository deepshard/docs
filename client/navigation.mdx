### Settings

You can control certain parts of your OS through the Settings view.

- <b>Server Status</b>: Server status displays the status of your client's connection to our cloud server
- <b>Apps</b>: The apps section shows all available apps and gives you the option to delete any 3rd party apps. Deleting an app will only remove it from your client.
- <b>Check for updates</b>: Clicking check for updates will check if your client is up to date and provide an option to download our most up-to-date version
