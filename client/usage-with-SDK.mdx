### Uploading a Custom App to Your Client

When you [create a custom app](/guides/a-simple-app), running `truffle upload` will upload the app to your client.

<Tip>You can view upload progress in the settings page's app section</Tip>

### Selecting Custom App

When the upload completes, your app will become an option for your agent's tool kit

When you select your custom app, its name will appear in the prompt bar's footer. Hovering over this will reveal your app's description.

<Tip>The primary color of your app icon will be used in the app name in the description</Tip>

### Tasks with Your Custom App

When your custom app is used in a task, its tool names will be referenced in each step's title.
