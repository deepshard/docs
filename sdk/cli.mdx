## Connecting to Your Truffle

### Step 1: Scan for Devices

Find Truffle devices on your local network:

```bash
truffile scan
```

```
✓ Scanning for Truffle devices (5s)

Found 6 Truffle device(s):

  1. truffle-6070 (192.168.1.109)
  2. truffle-5970 (192.168.1.104)
  3. truffle-6272 (192.168.1.32)
  4. truffle-7280 (192.168.1.87)
  5. truffle-0148 (192.168.1.60)
  6. truffle-6239 (192.168.1.129)

Select device to connect (1-6) or press Enter to cancel:
```

Select a device by entering its number.

### Step 2: Enter Your User ID

After selecting a device, you'll be prompted for your User ID:

```
✓ Resolving truffle-6272.local

  Make sure you have:
  • Onboarded with the Truffle app
  • Your User ID from the recovery codes

? Enter your User ID:
```

<Note>
You can find your User ID in the **Settings → About** section of your Truffle desktop client.
</Note>

### Step 3: Approve the Connection

After entering your User ID, you'll see:

```
✓ Connecting to device

• Requesting authorization...
  Please approve on your Truffle device
⠋ Waiting for approval
```

A dialog will appear on your Truffle client asking you to approve the connection:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/approve-connect.png" alt="Approve connection dialog" />
</Frame>

Click **Approve** to allow the connection.

```
✓ Waiting for approval

✓ Connected to truffle-6272
```

### Reconnecting Later

Once you've connected to a device, you can reconnect directly without scanning:

```bash
truffile connect truffle-6272
```

Your credentials are saved locally, so you won't need to re-enter your User ID or approve again.

---

## Disconnecting

To disconnect from all devices and clear your saved credentials:

```bash
truffile disconnect all
```

<Warning>
This will require you to go through the full connection process again (User ID + approval) the next time you want to connect.
</Warning>

To disconnect from a specific device:

```bash
truffile disconnect truffle-6272
```

---

## Deploying Apps

Once connected, you can deploy apps to your Truffle.

<Note>
If you haven't built an app yet, check out the [Building Apps](/sdk/building-apps) guide first.
</Note>

### Basic Deploy

Deploy an app from the current directory:

```bash
truffile deploy
```

Or specify a path to your app folder:

```bash
truffile deploy ./my-app
```

truffile will:
1. Validate your `truffile.yaml` configuration
2. Check syntax for all Python files
3. Determine if it's an **Ambient** (background) or **Focus** (foreground) app
4. Upload files and run installation steps
5. Register the app with your Truffle

### Interactive Mode

Deploy with an interactive terminal session for debugging:

```bash
truffile deploy -i
```

This uploads your files and opens a terminal inside your app's container. You can:
- Test your app manually
- Install additional dependencies
- Debug issues in real-time

<Tip>
You can even install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) inside the container to help fix or extend your app!

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```
</Tip>

Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D` to finish the deploy.
