## What Are Truffle Apps?

Truffle apps give your Truffle agent capabilities. They're containerized programs that run on your Truffle, providing tools and services the agent can use.

There are two types of apps:

| Type | When It Runs | What It Does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Focus** | On demand | Exposes tools Truffle can call when needed |
| **Ambient** | On a schedule | Runs periodically and posts to your feed |

## Focus Apps

Focus apps are **MCP servers** that expose tools Truffle can call on demand. When you ask your Truffle a question or ask it to do a task, it can invoke your app's tools to get the answer.

### How It Works

1. Your app runs an MCP server on port `8000`
2. Truffle sees your tools and their descriptions
3. When relevant, Truffle calls your tools
4. Your app returns data, and Truffle responds to you

### Example Use Cases

- **Finance tools** — get stock prices, company info, market news
- **Research tools** — web search, URL scraping, API queries
- **Integrations** — connect to any external service or API
- **Utilities** — calculators, converters, data processors

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Truffle  │      │   Focus App     │
│                 │      │                 │
│      Agent  ─────┼──────┼─► MCP Server    │
│                 │      │   (port 8000)   │
│                 │      │                 │
│                 │ ◄────┼── Tool Results  │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

## Ambient Apps

Ambient apps run **on a schedule** and post content to your feed. They're perfect for background tasks that surface information without you asking.

### How It Works

1. Your app runs on a schedule you define (every 5 minutes, hourly, at specific times, etc.)
2. It fetches or generates content
3. It posts to your feed using `post_to_feed()`
4. You see the content on your Truffle's home screen

### Example Use Cases

- **Stock trackers** — portfolio updates throughout the day
- **News aggregators** — curated headlines from your favorite sources
- **Social monitors** — Reddit, Twitter, or other social feeds
- **Alerts** — weather, calendar reminders, system notifications

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Truffle  │      │   Ambient App   │
│                 │      │                 │
│   Scheduler ────┼──────┼─► Run app       │
│                 │      │                 │
│   Feed ◄────────┼──────┼── post_to_feed()│
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
